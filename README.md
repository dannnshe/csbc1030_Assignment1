###Node.js Application Testing Guide

##Overview

This guide covers the setup and execution of unit and end-to-end tests for the ExpressJS application developed in Assignment 7, which interacts with a MySQL database to manage user data.

##Setting Up for Testing

1. Branching
Create a new branch from the prior assignment's branch:


git checkout -b testing-assignment

1. Install Testing Libraries
If not already installed, add testing libraries to your project:


npm install mocha chai supertest --save-dev
Writing Tests
Unit Tests
Create unit tests to cover the following cases for the GET /users/:id route:

Retrieving the authenticated user's entity.
Denying retrieval of a different user's entity, ensuring an appropriate error code is returned.
Denying retrieval of an entity when not authenticated, with the correct error code.
End-to-End Tests
Similarly, write end-to-end tests for the same cases:

Successful retrieval of the authenticated user's entity.
Denial of access to a different user's entity, with an appropriate error code.
Denial of access when not authenticated, returning the correct error code.
Running the Tests
Execute your tests using your test runner, for example, Mocha:

bash
Copy code
npx mocha
